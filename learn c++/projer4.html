          <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
 The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.</p>
          <p>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
           C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
           C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
          As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa</p>
          <p>C++ is fun and easy to learn!</p>

                    <header>What you should already know</header>
                    <p>Yes! C++ is nearly exactly a superset of Standard C95 (C90 and the 1995 Amendment 1). With very few exceptions, every valid C95 program is also a valid C++ program with the same meaning.

                              A great first step is to simply use C++ as “a better C,” which means that you can program in the C subset of C++ and find the experience better than in C because C++ provides extra type-checking and sometimes extra performance even for plain C code.</p>
                    <p>C++ is a direct descendant of C95 (C90 plus an Amendment) that retains almost all of C95 as a subset. C++ provides stronger type checking than C and directly supports a wider range of programming styles than C. C++ is “a better C” in the sense that it supports the styles of programming done using C with better type checking and more notational support (without loss of efficiency). In the same sense, ANSI C90/C95 is a better C than K&R C. In addition, C++ supports data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and generic programming (see The C++ Programming Language; Appendix B discussing compatibility issues is available for downloading).
                        C is often called a middle-level computer language since it combines the elements of high-level languages with the functionalism of assembly language. C allows the manipulation of bits, bytes, and addresses—giving the programmer more control over exactly how the program will behave and a more direct access to the mechanics of the underlying hardware. C was created, influenced, and field-tested by working programmers. The end result is that C gives the programmer what the programmer wants. C++ is an enhanced version of the C language. C++ includes everything that is part of C and adds support for object-oriented programming (OOP). In addition, C++ also contains many improvements and features that make it a "better C," independent of object-oriented programming.

                        <header>C and C++</header>
                        <p>As we know both C and C++ are programming languages and used for application development. The main difference between both these languages is C is a procedural programming language and does not support classes and objects, while C++ is a combination of both procedural and object-oriented programming languages.</p>

                            <li>As C does not support the OOPs concept so it has no support for polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance.</li>

                                   <p> You will use the keyword extern to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C program, it can be defined only once in a file, a function, or a block of code.</p>

                                    <p>A similar concept applies to variables in C. Variable scope refers to the accessibility of a variable in a given program or function. For example, a variable may only be available within a specific function (your apartment key), or it may be available to the entire C program (the shared access key).</p>

                                    <p>Global variables</p>
                                    <p>Global variables are defined outside a function, usually on top of the program. Global variables hold their values throughout the lifetime of your program and they can be accessed inside any of the functions defined for the program.</p>
                                    <p>A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration. The following program show how global variables are used in a program.</p>

                                Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.</p>
